# Cryptodog

Cryptodog is a community-developed fork of the original Cryptocat browser extension, which was [discontinued in February 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160225040533/https://crypto.cat/).

We offer two things:

* A modified Cryptocat client, tweaked for security, performance, aesthetics, and usability
* A public, anonymous-login XMPP server (crypto.dog)

## Disclaimer
Cryptodog is experimental software that may have vulnerabilities. Don't use Cryptodog if you have a critical need for secure messaging.

If in doubt, use a vetted secure messenger like [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/).

## Usage

The recommended way to use Cryptodog is via our [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptodog/blnkmmamdbladdaaddkjbecbphngeiec) extension. This ensures that you always have the official, most up-to-date version.

## Bugs

Bug reports are encouraged! If you find a flaw in the Cryptodog client or server, please open an issue here on GitHub.

If you believe the issue is particularly sensitive with regard to security, we would appreciate coordinated disclosure. Please email us at security@crypto.dog.

## Contact

General queries should be sent to contact@crypto.dog.

### Reporting Abuse
We (the Cryptodog developers) do not endorse any content that users share over the platform. To report abuse of the service, please email us at contact@crypto.dog. However, please note that:

* Because Cryptodog uses end-to-end (client-side) encryption, we do not have the ability to view the plaintext contents of any messages or files.
* We do not log or otherwise save encrypted user content; it exists only transiently in server memory.
